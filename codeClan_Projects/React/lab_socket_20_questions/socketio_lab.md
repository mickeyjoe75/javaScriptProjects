# Socket.io Lab

Practice creating a real time app using Socket.io and React.

## Option 1

Make the game 20 Questions using the start point we have provided for you.

The Chooser thinks of a celebrity and the Guesser tries to guess the chosen celebrity by asking yes/no questions. 

The GuesserContainer should emit question events and listen for answer events
The ChooserContainer should listen for the question events and emit answer events

You will need the server to listen for and re-emit both question and answer events.


# Option 2

Come up with your own idea for an app using Socket.io and React


## Planning

Think about the events you are going to emit and listen for.
Plan your React Components with their state and props before starting.
