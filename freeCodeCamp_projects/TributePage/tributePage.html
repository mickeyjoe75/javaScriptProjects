      <h4>Formative years and life's calling</h4>
      <p>He was born on 26 November 1921 in Kozhikode, Madras Presidency (now in Kerala) to a Syrian Christian family.He schooled
        at Diamond Jubilee Higher Secondary School, Gobichettipalayam, in Coimbatore district (now in Erode district, Tamil
        Nadu) while his father worked as a civil surgeon at the government hospital there. He joined Loyola College, in Madras
        at the age of 14, graduating in science with physics in 1940, and then got a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering
        from the College of Engineering, Guindy, Madras, in 1943 He had to fend for himself as he was young for his age in
        every class. This according to him, developed his sense of independence. He lost his father at 22 and his grand-uncle
        moved his family to his home in Trichur (now Thrissur). A keen military cadet and a boxer at college, when he wanted
        to join the army as an engineer, his mother persuaded him to join the Tata Steel Technical Institute, Jamshedpur
        on a recommendation to the management by his uncle, who was a director with the Tatas, and from where he graduated
        in 1946, but soon found himself wanting to get away from the hangers-on and yesmen of his uncle.</p>
      <p>So he left and applied for a government of India scholarship, and was chosen to study dairy engineering, an irrelevant
        discipline, much to his surprise and reluctance, but this time his uncle (by now, the finance minister) refused to
        bail him out. He was thus, sent to the Imperial Institute of Animal Husbandry in Bangalore (now, National Dairy Research
        Institute, southern station, Bengaluru) where he spent nine months, and merely bid time out to be sent to America.
        Here too, by choosing some dairying electives, rather perfunctorily, at Michigan State University, he returned with
        a master's degree in mechanical engineering (metallurgy) (with a minor in nuclear physics), instead, in 1948. While
        there, when he found himself at the receiving end of racist jibes, the Indian in him saw him, in his words, "put
        the natives back in their place".</p>

      <p>Later, he would say, "I was sent to ... study dairy engineering (on the only government scholarship left) ... I cheated
        a bit though, and studied metallurgical and nuclear engineering, disciplines ... likely to be of far greater use
        to my soon-to-be independent country and, quite frankly, to me."</p>

      <p>He did train in dairy technology, with a sense of purpose eventually, in 1952-53, on a government sponsorship to New
        Zealand, a bastion of cooperative dairying then, and to Australia, when he had to learn to set up the Amul dairy.</p>

      <h4>Turning point</h4>
      <p>In 1949, Kurien was sent by the government of India to its run-down, experimental creamery at Anand, in Bombay province
        (later Bombay state & now part of Gujarat state since 1960), and began to work rather half-heartedly, to serve out
        his bond-period against the scholarship given by them for his master's degree. He began to while away his time going
        off to Bombay city on weekends and on some pretext of work or else, volunteering to tinker with the primitive dairy
        equipment of Tribhuvandas Patel, who sought his help to process the milk of farmers he had brought together after
        a strike in 1946, forming a cooperative society to purchase their milk, at Kaira (now, Kheda) nearby.</p>

      He had already made up his mind to quit the government job mid-way and leave Anand but, was persuaded by Tribhuvandas to
      stay back with him after quitting them, and help him set up his dairy.[30][31] Tribhuvandas's efforts and the trust
      placed in him by farmers inspired Kurien to dedicate himself to establishing that dairy cooperative, 'Kaira District
      Cooperative Milk Producers' Union Limited (KDCMPUL)' (which came to be known popularly as Amul dairy), at Anand.

      <h4>Work</h4>
      <h4>Foundation of the dairy and its pattern</h4>
      <p>The farmers faced a problem of fluctuating milk production as surplus milk would find no takers in the flush season,
        and turned to the cooperative for help, where an idea took root to try convert this surplus to milk powder. Kurien's
        batchmate from America and dairy engineer H. M. Dalaya, who he persuaded to stay back at Anand after a mere visit,
        invented the process of making skim milk powder and condensed milk from buffalo milk, instead of from cow milk, said
        impossible by dairy experts around the world.In India, buffalo milk was plentiful while, cow milk was in short supply,
        unlike Europe where it was abundant. This was the reason Amul would compete successfully and well against Nestle,
        the leading competitor, which used cow milk to make them, and later against Glaxo for baby food. Later research by
        Dr. G. H. Wilster led to cheese production from buffalo milk at Amul.To cut costs, Kurien got a captive packaging-tin
        unit attached to the dairy in a collaboration. Amul then took on established competitors, viz. government-run Aarey
        dairy's Bombay Milk Scheme and private-run Polson dairy, in the Bombay market, and gained a share with these products
        along with its famed butter.</p>
